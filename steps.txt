Steps to request and response logging middleware to help track info about client server communication


Setup virtual environment
Activate your virtual environment
Install django, djangorestframework
Put libraries installed with its versions in requirementd.txt file
Start project with the django-admin startproject projectname .
Create your app with the manage.py startapp command
Add app name to installed apps in settings
If no custom models are created, go straight to manage.py migrate [No custom models, No makemigrations]
Create urls for your app
Include your app urls in your project urls
Create your view for the paths in your app urls
Create custom middleware to accept 'request' as argument
Create create log using it level and the things request arguments can access [request.method, request.status_code]
Register your middle wear in the settings.middleware[Request middleware must come after common-middleware but before auth-middleware (Search for why request-log-middleware must come before and after them)]
Now add your LOGGING to settings to take care of formatting, where logs should appear, version, if other logging apps should stop etc
